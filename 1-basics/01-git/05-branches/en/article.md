# Branches

Branches are a mechanism that allows duplicating the commit history into multiple versions. They are very useful in collaborative work. Their basic use is to separate the changes made by one developer (Developer A) from those made by another developer (Developer B). This way, developers don't interfere with each other's work.

Branches have more than one purpose, and we will explore some additional uses of branches in a forthcoming article.
