# Collaborate with Git

Git is primarily used for sharing code with other developers and working together on a project. In this article, we will explore the various challenges and advantages of collaborative work with Git.

## Collaborative Platform: GitHub

A widely recognized platform in the world of development is GitHub. It is by far the most popular platform, and developers from around the world use it to host their projects. While there are other similar platforms, such as GitLab or BitBucket, GitHub is the favorite among developers. That's why we've chosen to present it here.

GitHub is a platform that hosts a variety of Git repositories. In addition to collaborating with other developers, it allows you to save a Git repository remotely (in the cloud), which is a significant advantage: the decentralization of projects. Imagine that you were to lose all the data on your hard drive; all your projects would be lost. Unless you had decentralized them through GitHub. In that case, you could recover your project from another computer.

In addition to being reassuring for your progress, GitHub is very user-friendly and easy to use. While it may seem daunting to a novice, trying it is adopting it. We will dedicate an entire chapter to GitHub because there is so much to say about it.
