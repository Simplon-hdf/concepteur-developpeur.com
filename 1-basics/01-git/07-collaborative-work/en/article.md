# Collaborate with Git

Git is primarily used for sharing code with other developers and working together on a project. In this article, we will explore the various challenges and advantages of collaborative work with Git.

## Collaborative Platform: GitHub

A widely recognized platform in the world of development is GitHub. It is by far the most popular platform, and developers from around the world use it to host their projects. While there are other similar platforms, such as GitLab or BitBucket, GitHub is the favorite among developers. That's why we've chosen to present it here.

GitHub is a platform that hosts a variety of Git repositories. In addition to collaborating with other developers, it allows you to save a Git repository remotely (in the cloud), which is a significant advantage: the decentralization of projects. Imagine that you were to lose all the data on your hard drive; all your projects would be lost. Unless you had decentralized them through GitHub. In that case, you could recover your project from another computer.

In addition to being reassuring for your progress, GitHub is very user-friendly and easy to use. While it may seem daunting to a novice, trying it is adopting it. We will dedicate an entire chapter to GitHub because there is so much to say about it.

## Workflow

A workflow is a way of working. There are different types of workflows when working collaboratively with Git and remote repositories. These can be seen as conventions aimed at streamlining collaborative work. These conventions exist to reduce the time spent on collaborative tool management.

We will discuss this topic much later. This section serves as an introduction, and it is a subject too vast to be detailed here.

## Remote Repositories

Just as there are local repositories, there are remote repositories. What we call a "remote repository" is simply a local repository that has been sent to online platforms (such as GitHub). There is a clear distinction to be made between these two types of repositories:

- A local repository is a repository stored on your machine.
- A remote repository is a repository stored on an online server.

The distinction may seem obvious, but there are some subtleties that are good to know to get started with GitHub effectively.

A remote repository is a version that may be different from your local version of the repository. There are commands to retrieve the latest version from the remote repository, which we will cover later. If you are working with other people, it is necessary to be aware that your version of the project may be outdated, so you will often need to use these commands.
