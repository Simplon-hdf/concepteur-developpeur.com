# Introduction

Application design is a broad subject that encompasses various aspects and stages that occur before the functional implementation of the project. Design comes in various forms, spanning multiple realizations that highlight different aspects of a project.

Throughout your application, keep in mind that **the design of a project is not set in stone and is subject to evolution** for various reasons. Perhaps a feature no longer aligns with the client's needs, or you may not have anticipated certain technical constraints. Don't be discouraged if you realize that your design requires some adjustments; this is perfectly normal.

Pro Tips: If you need to make changes due to a technical constraint encountered during the project implementation stage, try, if possible (unless you're working on a tightly scheduled corporate project, for example), to revisit the part of your design that needs adjustments rather than postponing it. It's more advantageous to pause your implementation to engage in reflective work to resolve the encountered issue, rather than having to rework your code and redesign it later.

I've personally experienced both approaches (retro-design and design), and it's much more rewarding to pause your coding session to adjust your design and then continue coding with the new design version. It's better than trying to develop your feature by trial and error and then redo your design while trying to match the behavior of your code.

Keep this in mind, even if it may seem abstract as a concept at the moment.
