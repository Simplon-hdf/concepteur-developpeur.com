# Before Design

There are a few *preliminary steps* to take before *designing an application*. Indeed, you shouldn't dive into creating diagrams as soon as you receive a project; there are a **plethora of steps** that may seem obvious but will make the difference between **a basic developer** and a **serious designer**. This article will provide you with the key steps to start a project **in the best possible way**.

While reading this section, consider the following questions:

- **What is the goal of a developer**?
- **What does it mean to be a good designer**? (*Even though this may seem trivial at first glance*)

## Understanding the **Client's Needs**

The first thing a designer needs to do is **understand the client's needs**.

This step is **absolutely crucial** for the entire life of your project. *If you misunderstand what your client needs, you can't undertake any development*. Why ? Because if you misunderstand, and the client doesn't find a solution to their issues in your work, you risk **losing** and **causing a loss of**:

- **Time**
- **Energy**
- Money
- **Trust** (From the client towards your company, from your company and colleagues towards you, from yourself towards yourself, which, in my opinion, is the worst thing that can happen to you)

Note that we are talking about **needs** and not **client requests**. This is what distinguishes a **developer** who **listens to the client's request** and a designer who **seeks the client's needs**.

To give you an image, let's consider an example:

```
Suppose you are at a restaurant, and you order a Couscous.
The waiter returns about 20 minutes later with a Ribeye steak.
```

It's highly likely that you won't go back to that restaurant, right?

Now, let's consider another scenario:

```
Suppose you are at a restaurant, and you order a Couscous.
The waiter returns about 20 minutes later with your Couscous, but you realize it wasn't exactly what you wanted.
```

The waiter acted like a good **developer**; he served you what you **requested**.

And to conclude the reasoning:

```
Suppose you are at a restaurant, and you order a dish with meat and fries, but at the same time, you would like something that isn't dry, although you're not exactly sure what.
The waiter listens to you and takes note of what you desire.
He returns about 20 minutes later with a Burger, fries, and a salad. You finish your meal and thank the waiter for bringing you exactly what you needed.
```

The waiter acted as a **designer**; *you didn't know what you wanted yourself*, but **he found** exactly what you **needed**.

Being a designer is not just about listening to what a client requests; it is primarily about **understanding the issues** they face and trying to **resolve** them.

In the vast majority of cases, the client is aware of certain issues they face, which is the reason for their contact. However, **they are not aware of all their needs**. **The designer's job** is primarily to **put themselves in the client's shoes**, **understand the client's business layer**, **evaluate the various aspects of it**, **become aware of all the issues and provide solutions**.

It is not uncommon to encounter a client who has not yet started their business and comes to you for that purpose. In this case, it's even better; **the client has no constraints**, and you start with a *completely blank slate*.

However, it may happen that a client is very firm about the limits of a project, and you may meet clients who prefer to talk to developers rather than designers (they want a couscous and nothing else than a couscous). In this case, you know what they say: The customer is king.

## Developing Solutions

With the issues evaluated, all that remains is to **find solutions** to each of them, and believe it or not, **this is the simplest part of the process**, **this is it**.

It is recommended to create a list of issues in a living document. Within a GitHub repository in **Markdown** format, for example, this is one of the best solutions for this type of work. But don't limit yourself to that; this solution is viable for **evolving work**, or in an elaboration session, **prefer other document delivery formats** (such as **PDF**).

For each issue, find a **simple solution**, not simplistic, but **simple**. A solution should not require **disproportionate** efforts to resolve a single issue; use common sense. It can be difficult to step back from such work, which is why seeking the opinion of a third party (who can be a colleague unrelated to the project or a non-technical person) can be useful to help you realize what you are producing.

Once your solutions have been sufficiently **tested** in terms of **simplicity**, **relevance**, and **thought**, you can **document** your work in a **presentable document for the client**.
