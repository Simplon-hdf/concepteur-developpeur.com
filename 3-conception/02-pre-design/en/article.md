# Before Design

There are a few *preliminary steps* to take before *designing an application*. Indeed, you shouldn't dive into creating diagrams as soon as you receive a project; there are a **plethora of steps** that may seem obvious but will make the difference between **a basic developer** and a **serious designer**. This article will provide you with the key steps to start a project **in the best possible way**.

While reading this section, consider the following questions:

- **What is the goal of a developer**?
- **What does it mean to be a good designer**? (*Even though this may seem trivial at first glance*)

## Understanding the **Client's Needs**

The first thing a designer needs to do is **understand the client's needs**.

This step is **absolutely crucial** for the entire life of your project. *If you misunderstand what your client needs, you can't undertake any development*. Why ? Because if you misunderstand, and the client doesn't find a solution to their issues in your work, you risk **losing** and **causing a loss of**:

- **Time**
- **Energy**
- Money
- **Trust** (From the client towards your company, from your company and colleagues towards you, from yourself towards yourself, which, in my opinion, is the worst thing that can happen to you)

Note that we are talking about **needs** and not **client requests**. This is what distinguishes a **developer** who **listens to the client's request** and a designer who **seeks the client's needs**.

To give you an image, let's consider an example:

```
Suppose you are at a restaurant, and you order a Couscous.
The waiter returns about 20 minutes later with a Ribeye steak.
```

It's highly likely that you won't go back to that restaurant, right?

Now, let's consider another scenario:

```
Suppose you are at a restaurant, and you order a Couscous.
The waiter returns about 20 minutes later with your Couscous, but you realize it wasn't exactly what you wanted.
```

The waiter acted like a good **developer**; he served you what you **requested**.

And to conclude the reasoning:

```
Suppose you are at a restaurant, and you order a dish with meat and fries, but at the same time, you would like something that isn't dry, although you're not exactly sure what.
The waiter listens to you and takes note of what you desire.
He returns about 20 minutes later with a Burger, fries, and a salad. You finish your meal and thank the waiter for bringing you exactly what you needed.
```

The waiter acted as a **designer**; *you didn't know what you wanted yourself*, but **he found** exactly what you **needed**.

Being a designer is not just about listening to what a client requests; it is primarily about **understanding the issues** they face and trying to **resolve** them.

In the vast majority of cases, the client is aware of certain issues they face, which is the reason for their contact. However, **they are not aware of all their needs**. **The designer's job** is primarily to **put themselves in the client's shoes**, **understand the client's business layer**, **evaluate the various aspects of it**, **become aware of all the issues and provide solutions**.

It is not uncommon to encounter a client who has not yet started their business and comes to you for that purpose. In this case, it's even better; **the client has no constraints**, and you start with a *completely blank slate*.

However, it may happen that a client is very firm about the limits of a project, and you may meet clients who prefer to talk to developers rather than designers (they want a couscous and nothing else than a couscous). In this case, you know what they say: The customer is king.

## Developing Solutions

With the issues evaluated, all that remains is to **find solutions** to each of them, and believe it or not, **this is the simplest part of the process**, **this is it**.

It is recommended to create a list of issues in a living document. Within a GitHub repository in **Markdown** format, for example, this is one of the best solutions for this type of work. But don't limit yourself to that; this solution is viable for **evolving work**, or in an elaboration session, **prefer other document delivery formats** (such as **PDF**).

For each issue, find a **simple solution**, not simplistic, but **simple**. A solution should not require **disproportionate** efforts to resolve a single issue; use common sense. It can be difficult to step back from such work, which is why seeking the opinion of a third party (who can be a colleague unrelated to the project or a non-technical person) can be useful to help you realize what you are producing.

Once your solutions have been sufficiently **tested** in terms of **simplicity**, **relevance**, and **thought**, you can **document** your work in a **presentable document for the client**.

## Creating a Presentable Document

First and foremost, it's wise to know that if you are working with the Agile methodology, the term **Specifications Document** is a dirty word. If you don't know why, I invite you to read this [article](../../../1-basics/03-methodology/01-agile-method/en/article.md).

To create a presentable document for the client, it is essential that this document follows certain conventions to be taken seriously. All the elements in this article should be included or briefly addressed in your project document.

### The Context Section

A **context section** is **essential** in a document of this nature for a rather simple reason:

You show the client the **interest you have in this project** and demonstrate that you have **acknowledged their issues** by providing information about either:

- Their company
- Their industry

When reading this section, the client is **reading about their own company** or industry, which **saves you some work for the rest of the document**. They will be more inclined to read the document if they understand from the start that **the project revolves around them**, and that your team has taken the time to **research broader aspects**.

This doesn't mean you should write a 12 pages presentation on the client's personal life. Instead, it's about putting the project into context, including information about your client's company if possible. To help you understand, let's take an example:

Let's say a client in the automotive sector is requesting a website for online appointment scheduling. A contextual section could be formatted like this:

```
Cars&Motors is a family-owned business
with the aim of streamlining its communication with its customers.
Cars&Motors has been in business for over 20 years and achieves a goal
of 10 daily appointments...
```

The idea is to show the client that you are involved and that you will do your best to provide a solution that suits their needs. By incorporating this section into your documents, you **facilitate communication** with the client. Because what's better for a client than **feeling understood** and that someone **cares about their issues**?

Think of this section as an inception of the project or a way to reel in the fish, if you prefer.

### Presentation of the Project Team

This section is important as it introduces the team members responsible for the project. **It's not about presenting team members personally**, but about explaining **who** will have **which role** within the project. For example:

```
- Mr. B: Developer of the solution
- Mr. N: Developer of the solution
- Mr. C: Responsible for the proper implementation of the working methodology
- Mr. B: Responsible for communication between the team and the client.
...
```

Here is a concrete example. It is advisable to be concise. **The client** is not looking to become friends with the team; they only want to **know** and **understand what they are paying for**. This section is there to show them that you care about this aspect and also implicitly **explains the costs of a project** by showing the client the **staff employed** to ensure the success of their project.

This section is **not absolutely essential**, but it is **highly recommended** to include it. In a document aimed at establishing a project, it's better for the client to have more information that interests them rather than a document that they would find uninteresting. (Take this with a grain of salt, don't start listing your lunch break hours.) Keep in mind that **you must remain relevant** in your approach.

### Very Brief Presentation of Your Working Methodology

This section **is absolutely essential**. It might not seem like much, but believe me, omitting this section could have **catastrophic consequences**.

Before explaining further, let's take an example:

```
Imagine you go to the mechanic to change your tires,
and the mechanic doesn't tell you how they are going to do it.
You come back an hour later, and to your astonishment, your car is in pieces.
You're not a mechanic, so you have absolutely no idea if this is normal.
But the mechanic tells you they always do it this way.
As a result, they ask you to come back in two weeks to let them do their work,
and they add that the bill will be quite steep.
```

You would have liked your mechanic to tell you how they were going to work so you could plan accordingly (and incidentally, to find a real mechanic rather than a scammer). In this type of project, it's the same. The client has absolutely no knowledge of the customs in the field, and that's fine because it's not their role. However, your role is to **briefly explain** how the **work** on the project will be **completed**.

But keep in mind that **you are not there to give them a complete lesson** on the methodology you will adopt. Would you like your mechanic to explain every step they will take to change your tires in the smallest detail? (Keep this image in mind; it could be quite helpful.) The idea is to **reassure the client** and, most importantly, to explain how the **collaboration** will go so they don't have any unpleasant surprises once the project starts.

### Presentation of the Issues Studied and Corresponding Solutions

Now that the client has had a glimpse of **your professionalism**, it's time to discuss the heart of the project, the problems. But more importantly, the solutions—try to avoid emphasizing the problems too much and focus on highlighting the solutions instead.

The idea behind this approach is to show that you have clearly **grasped the project's challenges** and have identified **problems that the client might not have considered** (but don't go creating problems where there aren't any).

For this section of **highlighting the solutions**, it's better to opt for a more **visual approach**. For example, you can use a **table** that displays the problems, divided into issues, with the **solutions** summarized in a brief sentence on the right. This approach encourages the reader to first look at the problems, followed by the issues arising from them, and then, like a deus ex machina, your solutions. **The reader finishes reading on a positive note**. This offers several advantages:

- It doesn't leave the client with a bitter feeling after going through your table.
- The reader can quickly and clearly understand the information since it's very succinct.
- There's no need to make an effort to understand and concentrate to extract information from a jumble of text.

Once you have briefly presented:

- The problems
- The issues
- **The solutions**

You can then go into detail for each solution in dedicated subsections for each issue and solution.

### Presentation of Project Targets (Personas)

A step that seems more than welcome is the presentation of project targets, or in other words: **Who are the client's business targets**?

The term "targets" can be seen as reductive; instead, we can use the term **personas**. A persona simply refers to the **different profiles** of users of a finished (or atleast distribued) product. It is helpful to create a list of personas in order to:

- Show the client which audience the product is targeting.
- Confirm with the client that the personas align with their experience or are relevant.

Moreover, it allows you to **align** the client's product with the **target audience**, for example:

```
The services of a mechanic target people who drive cars.
The services of a designer target people who need to develop digital products.
```

While this may seem trivial, in practice, this step requires some **thought and rigor**.

## The Benefits

Creating a document like this is beneficial for several reasons:

- You demonstrate your commitment to the project to the client.
- You establish a solid baseline on which you can rely.
- You clearly state what you have taken into account in your thinking.

There are other good reasons, such as allowing the client to **make corrections** to the points with which they disagree from the beginning, rather than **after receiving an initial functional version**. However, these are the three main ones.

Anyway, it's mandatory to establish a project kick-off document with the client. Just consider it as a part, albeit not very fun, but **very enriching aspect of the job**.

Depending on your methodology, the name of such a document may change, but its purpose is carved in stone; you must **persuade the client** to give you the project, and with a document like this, you are heading in the right direction.

## Structure and Format

Regarding the structure of this document, we recommend a structure that follows the order of appearance in this article, which includes:

- Setting the Context
- Team Presentation
- Presentation of Problems, Issues, and Solutions
  - Subsection about Solution 1
  - Subsection about Solution 2
  - Subsection ...
- Identification of Personas
- Conclusion

You don't have to follow this structure strictly, but it seems interesting in terms of organization. However, create a structure that seems **relevant** and **cohesive** to you.

As for the format of your document, when working on the document and you don't have a final version or it's not yet well-established, we recommend using Markdown. It is quick, lightweight, and concise.

However, when you intend to distribute your document, prefer a widely-used format like PDF, for example.

# Summary

- Being a designer means **seeking to understand the client's need**.
- Being a developer means simply listening to the client's **request**.
- Creating a comprehensive project kickoff document has many advantages for both the client and you.
- It's much more important to focus on solutions than on problems.
- A fluid structure is more than necessary; choose the one that seems most effective to you.
- For working on a document: Use Markdown; for distribution: A more widely-used format like PDF.
