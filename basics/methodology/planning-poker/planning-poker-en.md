The *Fibonacci suit* is used for evalutations.
Like we search to **quantify the effort**, the message is clear : *biggest the scenario is*, **less evaluations will be accurates**.
The cards pack used for Planning Poker *must contains* following values : 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144.
Some simplify larges values turning them into 20, 40, 100... because the idea is "be globally good" instead of "be accurately wrong".
We generaly add 0 and 1/2 values.
