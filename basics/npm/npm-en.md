# What is Npm (Node Package Manager)

Npm is a **node package manager** used to import or publish Node packages with other developpers who uses Npm.

Npm is divided in 3 majors parts :

1. **Npm Website**

    The [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) website is useful to know which Node packages are availables on the Registry.

2. **CLI (Command Line Interface)**

    The CLI's the biggest part of Npm, because it's by the CLI that you'll **interact with Npm** and with the registry to **import packages** or **publish your packages**.

3. **Npm Registry**

    The **Npm registry** is a kind of a huge **database** who store **complete functionals application** and mostly **node packages** that you'll can **download** to use or **adapt** them to your needs.

# What is Npx (Node Package Executer)

Npx is a **Node package executer** (...).
Npx allow you to run remote packages, that means you didn' have to **download** them to **run**, you can just run package remotely by your **CLI** from the **registry**, it can be useful to run **complete functionals application**.

Please note that generally, we prefer perform remote run on light applications.
