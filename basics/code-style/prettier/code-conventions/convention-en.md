## Definition

It exists differents ways of writing code. In a way to uniform code between developpers, companies began to develop some conventions. These conventions are used by teams for making their code intelligible and readable for all. 

Conventions covered differents domains: 

- Indentation style
- Variable declaration type
- Organisationnal / Structural arrangment
- 
In this context, **linters** and **formatters** both modify our source code in order to make it clean and consistent. 

Following these rules of convention bring a lot of advantages like:

- A better software maintenance (40 to 80 % less cost of maintenance)
- Improve readabilty of code for other software engineers and make _code review_ easy.

## Most used conventions 

The biggest tech compagnies developed their own conventions for Javascript writing: 

- [**Standard Style Guide**](https://github.com/standard/standard) : Contains a linter and a formatter, follow by GitHub, NPM, Heroku or MongoDB.
  - No configuration, easy to use. 
  - Automatically format your code.

- [**Google Style Guide**](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) : Google also released a guide for javascript, but also for HTML / CSS / C++ / TypeScript or Angular. 
  - Taken in charge by ESLint

- [**Airbnb StyleGuide**](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) : One of the most popular. From objects to performance testing. Offer conventions for CSS, JS, Ruby and React. It is appreciated for it :
  - Consistency
  - Readability
  - Predictability
  - Efficacity

- [**Clean Code Style Guide**](https://github.com/ ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript) : Taken from the book of Robert C. Martin, principles of this book have been taken and applied to JavaScript development. It is more like a list of good practices for a better readability of Javascript.

**_In this tutorial, we will follow the Airbnb Convention with a JavaScript stack._**
